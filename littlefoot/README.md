Littlefoot programs
===================

This directory contains a few example littlefoot programs for LUMI Keys.
On Mac, you can use the ROLI-provided BLOCKS CODE. On Linux, you can use 
testblocks from https://github.com/agraef/myblocks.

The littlefoot language is described [here](https://docs.juce.com/blocks/the_littlefoot_language.html).
The API can be found [here](https://docs.juce.com/blocks/group__LittleFootFunctions.html).

* `LUMI Keys Block Default Program.littlefoot`: the default program of LUMI (as found in ROLI Dashboard resources)
* `random_colors.littlefoot`: all key colors change randomly everytime a key is pressed
* `fade.littefoot`: pressed keys persist for a while
* `ripple.littlefoot`: key presses are propagated to neighboring keys
